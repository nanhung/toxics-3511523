  abstract = {Environmental exposures are ubiquitous and play a significant, and sometimes understated, role in public health as they can lead to the development of various chronic and infectious diseases. In an ideal world, there would be sufficient experimental data to determine the health effects of exposure to priority environmental contaminants. However, this is not the case, as emerging chemicals are continuously added to this list, furthering the data gaps. Recently, simulation science has evolved and can provide appropriate solutions using a multitude of computational methods and tools. In its quest to protect communities across the country from environmental health threats, ATSDR employs a variety of simulation science tools such as Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling, and benchmark dose (BMD) modeling, among others. ATSDR’s use of such tools has enabled the agency to evaluate exposures in a timely, efficient, and effective manner. ATSDR’s work in simulation science has also had a notable impact beyond the agency, as evidenced by external researchers’ widespread appraisal and adaptation of the agency’s methodology. ATSDR continues to advance simulation science tools and their applications by collaborating with researchers within and outside the agency, including other federal/state agencies, NGOs, the private sector, and academia.},

	abstract = {Route-to-route extrapolation is a common part of human risk assessment. Data from oral animal toxicity studies are commonly used to assess the safety of various but specific human dermal exposure scenarios. Using theoretical examples of various user scenarios, it was concluded that delineation of a generally applicable human dermal limit value is not a practicable approach, due to the wide variety of possible human exposure scenarios, including its consequences for internal exposure. This paper uses physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modelling approaches to predict animal as well as human internal exposure dose metrics and for the first time, introduces the concept of Margin of Internal Exposure (MOIE) based on these internal dose metrics. Caffeine was chosen to illustrate this approach. It is a substance that is often found in cosmetics and for which oral repeated dose toxicity data were available. A rat PBK model was constructed in order to convert the oral NOAEL to rat internal exposure dose metrics, i.e. the area under the curve (AUC) and the maximum concentration (Cmax), both in plasma. A human oral PBK model was constructed and calibrated using human volunteer data and adapted to accommodate dermal absorption following human dermal exposure. Use of the MOIE approach based on internal dose metrics predictions provides excellent opportunities to investigate the consequences of variations in human dermal exposure scenarios. It can accommodate within-day variation in plasma concentrations and is scientifically more robust than assuming just an exposure in mg/kg bw/day.},

Exposure estimates are key inputs into the risk assessment. Both agencies released draft risk assessments for endosulfan in the same time frame, and while some exposure estimates were similar, many differed considerably. This paper focuses on the differences in exposure estimates for individuals involved in endosulfan applications (handler exposures). Although CDPR and USEPA relied on the same data sets for their exposure estimates for most handler scenarios, CDPR estimates were in some cases more than an order of magnitude higher than estimates from USEPA. Reasons underlying these disparities, and their effects on risk estimates and resulting regulatory decisions, are discussed in this paper. Additionally, because of differences in legal mandates, CDPR estimated exposures for scenarios lacking data, whereas USEPA did not.},

	volume = {251},
	issn = {0013-9351},
	abstract = {Background
Pyrethroids are widely used pesticides and are suspected to affect children's neurodevelopment. The characterization of pyrethroid exposure during critical windows of development, such as fetal development and prenatal life, is essential to ensure a better understanding of pyrethroids potential effects within the concept of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.
Objective
The aim of this study was to estimate maternal exposure of French pregnant women from biomonitoring data and simulate maternal and fetal internal concentrations of 3 pyrethroids (permethrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin) using a multi-substance pregnancy-PBPK (physiologically based pharmacokinetics) model. The estimated maternal exposures were compared to newly proposed toxicological reference values (TRV) children specific also called draft child-specific reference value to assess pyrethroid exposure risk during pregnancy i.e. during the in utero exposure period.
Methods
A pregnancy-PBPK model was developed based on an existing adult pyrethroids model. The maternal exposure to each parent compound of pregnant women of the Elfe (French Longitudinal Study since Childhood) cohort was estimated by reverse dosimetry based on urinary biomonitoring data. To identify permethrin and cypermethrin contribution to their common urinary biomarkers of exposure, an exposure ratio based on biomarkers in hair was tested. Finally, exposure estimates were compared to current and draft child-specific reference values derived from rodent prenatal and postnatal exposure studies.
Results
The main contributor to maternal pyrethroid diet intake is cis-permethrin. In blood, total internal concentrations main contributor is deltamethrin. In brain, the major contributors to internal pyrethroid exposure are deltamethrin for fetuses and cis-permethrin for mothers. Risk is identified only for permethrin when referring to the draft child-specific reference value. 2.5\% of the population exceeded permethrin draft child-specific reference value.
Conclusions
A new reverse dosimetry approach using PBPK model combined with human biomonitoring data in urine and hair was proposed to estimate Elfe pregnant population exposure to a pyrethroids mixture with common metabolites.},

This work tested the hypothesis that blood and brain concentrations of the pyrethroid bifenthrin are predictive of neurotoxic effects. Adult male Long Evans rats received a single oral dose of bifenthrin dissolved in corn oil. Using figure-eight mazes, motor activity was measured for 1h at 4- and 7-h following exposure to bifenthrin (0–16mg/kg or 0–9mg/kg, respectively; n=4–8/group). Whole blood and brains were collected immediately following motor activity assays. Bifenthrin concentrations in blood and brain were quantified using HPLC/MS/MS. Bifenthrin exposure decreased motor activity from 20\% to 70\% in a dose-dependent manner at both time points. The relationship between motor activity data and administered dose, and blood and brain bifenthrin concentrations were described using a sigmoidal Emax model. The relationships between motor activity and administered dose or blood concentrations were different between the 4- and 7-h time points. The relationship between motor activity and brain concentration was not significantly different between the two time points. These data suggest that momentary brain concentration of bifenthrin may be a more precise dose metric for predicting behavioral effects because the relationship between brain concentration and locomotor activity is independent of the time of exposure.},

New models and methods to address population variability can be used to advance the human health assessments of chemicals in three key areas. First, with respect to hazard identification, evaluating toxicity using population-based in vitro and in vivo models can potentially reduce both false positive and false negative signals. Second, with respect to evaluating mechanisms of toxicity, enhanced ability to do genetic mapping using these models allows for the identification of key biological pathways and mechanisms that may be involved in toxicity and/or susceptibility. Third, with respect to dose–response assessment, population-based toxicity data can serve as a surrogate for human variability, and thus be used to quantitatively estimate the degree of human toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic variability and thereby increase confidence in setting health-protective exposure limits. A number of case studies have been published that demonstrate the potential opportunities for improving risk assessment and decision-making, and include studies using Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred mice, as well as populations of human cell lines from the 1000 Genomes project. Key challenges include the need to apply more sophisticated computational and statistical models analyzing population-based toxicity data, and the need to integrate these more complex analyses into risk assessments and decision-making.},

	abstract = {In order to characterize exposure of the Canadian population to environmental chemicals, a human biomonitoring component has been included in the Canadian Health Measures Survey ({CHMS}). This nationally-representative survey, launched in 2007 by the Government of Canada, has measured over 250 chemicals in approximately 30,000 Canadians during the last decade. The capacity to interpret these data at the population level in a health risk context is gradually improving with the development of biomonitoring screening values, such as biomonitoring equivalents ({BE}) and human biomonitoring ({HBM}) values. This study evaluates recent population level biomonitoring data from the {CHMS} in a health risk context using biomonitoring screening values. Nationally representative biomonitoring data for fluoride, selenium, molybdenum, arsenic, silver, thallium, cyfluthrin, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-{PBA}), chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin, bisphenol A, triclosan, acrylamide, cadmium, perfluorooctane sulfonate ({PFOS}), perfluorooctanoic acid ({PFOA}), bromoform, chloroform, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, styrene and tetrachloroethylene were screened as part as this study. For non-cancer endpoints, hazard quotients ({HQs}) were calculated as the ratio of population level concentrations of a specific chemical at the geometric mean and 95th percentile to the corresponding biomonitoring screening value. Cancer risks were calculated at the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the population concentration using {BEs} based on a risk specific dose. Most of the chemicals analyzed had {HQs} below 1 suggesting that levels of exposure to these chemicals are not a concern at the population level. However, {HQs} exceeded 1 in smokers for cadmium, acrylamide and benzene, as well as in the general population for inorganic arsenic, {PFOS} and {PFOA}, 3-{PBA} and fluoride. Furthermore, cancer risks for inorganic arsenic, acrylamide, and benzene at most population percentiles of exposure were elevated ({\textgreater}10-5). Specifically, for inorganic arsenic in the general population, the {HQ} was 3.13 at the 95th percentile concentration and the cancer risk was 3.4 × 10-4 at the 50th percentile of population concentrations. These results suggest that the levels of exposure in the Canadian population to some of the environmental chemicals assessed might be of concern. The results of this screening exercise support the findings of previous risk assessments and ongoing efforts to reduce risks from exposure to chemicals evaluated as part of this study. Although paucity of biomonitoring screening values for several environmental contaminants may be a limitation to this approach, our assessment contributes to the prioritization of a number of chemicals measured as part of {CHMS} for follow-up activities such as more detailed characterization of exposure sources.},

	volume = {15},
	issn = {1053-4245},
	abstract = {A total organophosphorus pesticide exposure study was conducted in Washington State in 1998 in a sample population of 13 children aged 2.5-5.5 years. The children were roughly split between rural and suburban populations and had been previously identified as having potentially elevated organophosphorus pesticide exposures. One component of the study was urine collection and analysis. Urine samples were collected from each subject up to four times in 24 h in two different seasons. Samples were collected at specific time points: before bed, first morning void, after lunch, and before dinner. Urine samples were analyzed initially for the six nonspecific dialkylphosphate ({DAP}) metabolites and subsequently for eight specific metabolites including malathion dicarboxylic acid ({MDA}), 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ({TCPy}), and paranitrophenol ({PNP}). Relatively large percentages of the urine samples contained quantifiable amounts of two of the nonspecific {DAP} metabolites ({DMTP}-97\%; {DETP}-67\%), and three of the specific metabolites ({MDA} (71\%), {TCPy} (79\%), and {PNP} (96\%)). A percent deviation analysis was employed to determine which of the spot sample time points was the best predictor of the estimated volume-weighted daily average. Of the four spot samples collected, first morning void samples were consistently found to be the best predictors of weighted-average daily metabolite concentration. This finding also held when the data were creatinine-adjusted. The results of this analysis suggest that if spot sampling is to be conducted as part of a biological monitoring study, first morning void samples should be preferentially collected.},

	volume = {92},
	issn = {1096-0295},
	abstract = {3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3-{PBA}) is a common metabolite of several pyrethroid pesticides of differing potency and also occurs as a residue in foods resulting from environmental degradation of parent pyrethroid compounds. Thus, 3-{PBA} in urine is not a specific biomarker of exposure to a particular pyrethroid. However, an approach derived from the use of Biomonitoring Equivalents ({BEs}) can be used to estimate a conservative initial screening value for a tiered assessment of population data on 3-{PBA} in urine. A conservative generic urinary excretion fraction for 3-{PBA} was estimated from data for five pyrethroid compounds with human data. Estimated steady-state urinary 3-{PBA} concentrations associated with reference doses and acceptable daily intakes for each of the nine compounds ranged from 1.7 μg/L for cyhalothrin and deltamethrin to 520 μg/L for permethrin. The lower value can be used as a highly conservative Tier 1 screening value for assessment of population urinary 3-{PBA} data. A second tier screening value of 87 μg/L was derived based on weighting by relative exposure estimates for the different pyrethroid compounds, to be applied as part of the data evaluation process if biomonitoring data exceed the Tier 1 value. These {BE} values are most appropriately used to evaluate the central tendency of population biomarker concentration data in a risk assessment context. The provisional {BEs} were compared to available national biomonitoring data from the {US} and Canada.},

	shorttitle = {Interpreting variability in population biomonitoring data},
	abstract = {Biomarker concentrations in spot samples of blood and urine are implicitly interpreted as direct surrogates for long-term exposure magnitude in a variety of contexts including (1) epidemiological studies of potential health outcomes associated with general population chemical exposure, and (2) cross-sectional population biomonitoring studies. However, numerous factors in addition to exposure magnitude influence biomarker concentrations in spot samples, including temporal variation in spot samples because of elimination kinetics. The influence of half-life of elimination relative to exposure interval is examined here using simple first-order pharmacokinetic simulations of urinary concentrations in spot samples collected at random times relative to exposure events. Repeated exposures were modeled for each individual in the simulation with exposure amounts drawn from lognormal distributions with varying geometric standard deviations. Relative variation in predicted spot sample concentrations was greater than the variation in underlying dose distributions when the half-life of elimination was shorter than the interval between exposures, with the degree of relative variation increasing as the ratio of half-life to exposure interval decreased. Results of the modeling agreed well with data from a serial urine collection data set from the Centers for Disease Control. Data from previous studies examining intra-class correlation coefficients for a range of chemicals relying upon repeated sampling support the importance of considering the half-life relative to exposure frequency in design and interpretation of studies using spot samples for exposure classification and exposure estimation. The modeling and data sets presented here provide tools that can assist in interpretation of variability in cross-sectional biomonitoring studies and in design of studies utilizing biomonitoring data as markers for exposure.},
